### What is Pizzaria Real ü§î? 

Pizzaria real is a pizzeria from Barbacena, Brazil the is known for its quality and excellent flavors, I am creating this website for study purposes. I will use technologies such as 

* ‚û°Jquery
* ‚û°AngularJS
* ‚û°VueJS
* ‚û°ReactJS
* ‚û°PHP

and much more


The project is a website where you can order your pizza online. It's a personal project 100% designed by me and will be released as a Saas soon.

First, the user will open the menu and select the flavor, a $('div').click will run and open a menu where the client will set the quantity, the size, and stuffed edge.

When the order is complete, the client will be redirected to a page where he will confirm what he just selected and inform his address. An object will be created and sent to the admin page by **AJAX**. The admin user will be able to print the order and send to the kitchen, so the pizza will be prepared. The order will be saved in a MySQL database and will be able to be fetched and shown on the admin screen.



**Next step**: Fix bugs
